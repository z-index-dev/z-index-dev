- 👋 Hi, my name is Zach Shelton
- 👀 I’m interested in all things JavaScript and modern web development, minus the web3 and crypto spaces (happy to talk about why)
- 🌱 I’m currently all-in on the React universe, currently focusing on TypeScript and Next.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a surf forecast application. It's a top-end goal of mine
- 📫 Reach me at zachshelton91 at gmail!
